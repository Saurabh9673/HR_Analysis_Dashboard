## 1 Query :

## SQL Query Insights: Average Attrition Rate by Department

### Overview
This SQL query calculates the average attrition rate for various departments within an organization. The attrition rate is derived from employee records, specifically identifying those who have left the company.

### Explanation
- **SELECT Statement**: The query selects two columns: `Department` and the average attrition rate.
- **CASE Statement**: It uses a `CASE` statement to evaluate the `Attrition` status:
  - If `Attrition` is `'yes'`, it counts as `1`.
  - If `Attrition` is anything else, it counts as `0`.
- **Avg Function**: The `Avg` function calculates the average of the values produced by the `CASE` statement for each department.
- **FROM Clause**: The data is sourced from the `hr_1` table, which contains employee records.
- **GROUP BY Clause**: Results are grouped by `Department`, allowing for a department-wise average calculation.

### Insights
- The average attrition rate is calculated as a decimal value, representing the proportion of employees who have left the department.
- Departments with higher attrition rates may indicate potential issues, such as employee dissatisfaction or better opportunities elsewhere.
- This analysis can help HR departments to devise strategies for employee retention and improve workplace conditions.

### Usage
This SQL query can be utilized in HR analytics to monitor and analyze employee turnover trends across different departments. By regularly assessing attrition rates, organizations can take proactive measures to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.

## 2 Query :

### Overview
This SQL query is designed to calculate the average hourly rate of male Research Scientists from a dataset represented in the `hr_1` table. It utilizes the `AVG()` function to compute the average based on specific filtering criteria.

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Comment**:
   - The line starting with `--` is a comment indicating the purpose of the query, which is to calculate the average hourly rate for male Research Scientists.

2. **SELECT Statement**:
   - `SELECT AVG(HourlyRate) AS Avg_Hourly_Rate`: This line selects the average of the `HourlyRate` column and renames the output column to `Avg_Hourly_Rate`.

3. **FROM Clause**:
   - `FROM hr_1`: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is named `hr_1`.

4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those records where:
     - `gender = 'Male'`: Only male employees are considered.
     - `JobRole = 'Research Scientist'`: Only employees with the job role of Research Scientist are included.

### Result Interpretation
- The result of the query displays the average hourly rate for the filtered group. In the provided output:
  - **Avg_Hourly_Rate**: `114.4469`
  
This means that the average hourly rate for male Research Scientists in the dataset is approximately **114.45**.

### Usage

## 3 Query :

## SQL Query Insights: Attrition Rate vs. Monthly Income

### Query Overview

The SQL query is designed to analyze the relationship between employee attrition rates and their monthly income. It aggregates the data to provide insights into how attrition varies with different income levels.

#### Components of the Query:

1. **SELECT Statement**:
   - The query selects two main components:
     - `Attrition_rate`: This calculates the total number of employees who have left (where `Attrition` is 'yes').
     - `Monthly_Income`: The income of employees from the second table.

2. **SUM with CASE**:
   - The `SUM(CASE WHEN...)` structure counts the number of employees who have left the company. If `Attrition` is 'yes', it adds 1; otherwise, it adds 0.

3. **FROM Clause**:
   - Data is pulled from two tables:
     - `hr_1` (aliased as `h1`): Contains employee information.
     - `hr_2` (aliased as `h2`): Contains income details.

4. **JOIN Condition**:
   - A join is performed on `EmployeeNumber` from `hr_1` and `EmployeeID` from `hr_2` to correlate employee records with their income.

5. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - The results are grouped by `Monthly_Income`, allowing for aggregation of attrition rates for each income level.

6. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - The results are ordered in descending order of `Monthly_Income`, meaning higher incomes will appear first in the results.

#### Insights from Results:

- **High Attrition at Certain Income Levels**: The table indicates that certain income brackets may have a higher attrition rate. For instance, an income of 50999 has an attrition rate of 2, suggesting potential issues at this income level.
  
- **Zero Attrition for Other Income Levels**: Some income levels show no attrition, which may indicate employee satisfaction or stability within those income brackets.

## 6 Query :

## SQL Query Insights

### Overview
This SQL query is designed to analyze the relationship between employee attrition rates and the number of years since their last promotion. It aggregates data from two tables (`hr_1` and `hr_2`) to compute the total attrition rate for employees based on how long it has been since they were last promoted.

### Explanation
- **SELECT Clause**: 
  - `h2.YearsSinceLastPromotion` is selected and renamed as `Year_Since_Last_Promotion`.
  - A `SUM` function calculates the total attrition rate by counting the number of employees who have left the organization (`Attrition = 'yes'`).

- **FROM Clause**: 
  - The query retrieves data from two tables: `hr_1` (which contains employee attrition information) and `hr_2` (which contains promotion history).

- **JOIN Clause**: 
  - An inner join is performed on `EmployeeNumber` from `hr_1` and `EmployeeID` from `hr_2` to link employee records.

- **GROUP BY Clause**: 
  - The results are grouped by `Year_Since_Last_Promotion` to calculate the attrition rate for each unique value of years since promotion.

- **ORDER BY Clause**: 
  - The results are sorted in ascending order based on `Year_Since_Last_Promotion`.

### Insights
- The results indicate that the attrition rate tends to decrease as the years since the last promotion increase.
- This could suggest that employees who have been promoted more recently are more likely to stay with the company, possibly due to increased job satisfaction or engagement following a promotion.
